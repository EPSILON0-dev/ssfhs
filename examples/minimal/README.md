# SSFHS - Minimal Setup

This directory contains the bare minimum setup for the server to function. Of course the server can run even without any config, but this should be considered the bare minimum.

## Contained files:
* **README.md** - You're reading it right now. ^^
* **index.html** - I guess this one is selfexplainatory.
* **favicon.ico** - This one too
* **ssfhs.conf** - Configures the index path and protects both the README and the config.
